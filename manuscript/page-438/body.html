A Martian has only to go a few miles to get a crowd on the run. And I saw one, one day, out by Wandsworth, picking houses to pieces and routing among the wreckage. But they won&rsquo;t keep on doing that. So soon as they&rsquo;ve settled all our guns and ships, and smashed our railways, and done all the things they are doing over there, they will begin catching us systematic, picking the best and storing us in cages and things. That&rsquo;s what they will start doing in a bit. Lord! They haven&rsquo;t begun on us yet. Don&rsquo;t you see that?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
