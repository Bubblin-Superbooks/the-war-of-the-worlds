<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Not begun!&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p><p>&ldquo;Not begun. All that&rsquo;s happened so far is through our not having the sense to keep quiet&mdash;worrying them with guns and such foolery. And losing our heads, and rushing off in crowds to where there wasn&rsquo;t any more safety than where we were. They don&rsquo;t want to bother us yet. They&rsquo;re making their things&mdash;making all the things they couldn&rsquo;t bring with them, getting things ready for the rest of their people. Very likely that&rsquo;s why the cylinders have stopped for a bit, for fear of hitting those who are here. And instead of our rushing about blind, on the howl, or getting dynamite on the chance of busting them up, we&rsquo;ve got to fix ourselves up according to the new state of affairs. That&rsquo;s how I figure it out. It isn&rsquo;t quite according to what a man wants for his species, but it&rsquo;s about what the facts point to.</p></div> </div>
