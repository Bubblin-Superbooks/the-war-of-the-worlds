A little farther on the dry reeds up the bank were smoking and glowing, and a line of fire inland was marching steadily across a late field of hay.</p><p>For a long time I drifted, so painful and weary was I after the violence I had been through, and so intense the heat upon the water. Then my fears got the better of me again, and I resumed my paddling. The sun scorched my bare back.

I suppose the time was then about four or five o&rsquo;clock. I got up presently, walked perhaps half a mile without meeting a soul, and then lay down again in the shadow of a hedge.</p></div> </div>
