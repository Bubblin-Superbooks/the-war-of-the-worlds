<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The main drains are big enough and airy enough for anyone. Then there&rsquo;s cellars, vaults, stores, from which bolting passages may be made to the drains. And the railway tunnels and subways. Eh? You begin to see? And we form a band&mdash;able-bodied, clean-minded men. We&rsquo;re not going to pick up any rubbish that drifts in. Weaklings go out again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As you meant me to go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I parleyed, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t quarrel about that. Go on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Those who stop obey orders. Able-bodied, clean-minded women we want also&mdash;mothers and teachers. No lackadaisical ladies&mdash;no blasted rolling eyes. We can&rsquo;t have any weak or silly. Life is real again, and the useless and cumbersome and mischievous have to die. They ought to die. They ought to be willing to die.</p></div> </div>
