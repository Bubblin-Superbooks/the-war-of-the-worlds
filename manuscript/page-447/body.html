We have to invent a sort of life where men can live and breed, and be sufficiently secure to bring the children up. Yes&mdash;wait a bit, and I&rsquo;ll make it clearer what I think ought to be done. The tame ones will go like all tame beasts; in a few generations they&rsquo;ll be big, beautiful, rich-blooded, stupid&mdash;rubbish! The risk is that we who keep wild will go savage&mdash;degenerate into a sort of big, savage rat. . . . You see, how I mean to live is underground. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about the drains. Of course those who don&rsquo;t know drains think horrible things; but under this London are miles and miles&mdash;hundreds of miles&mdash;and a few days rain and London empty will leave them sweet and clean.</p></div> </div>
