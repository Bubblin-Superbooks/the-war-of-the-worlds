<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Here too the evidence of a hasty rout was abundant along the road. I remember most vividly three smashed bicycles in a heap, pounded into the road by the wheels of subsequent carts. We crossed Richmond Bridge about half past eight. We hurried across the exposed bridge, of course, but I noticed floating down the stream a number of red masses, some many feet across. I did not know what these were&mdash;there was no time for scrutiny&mdash;and I put a more horrible interpretation on them than they deserved. Here again on the Surrey side were black dust that had once been smoke, and dead bodies&mdash;a heap near the approach to the station; but we had no glimpse of the Martians until we were some way towards Barnes.</p><p>We saw in the blackened distance a group of three people running down a side street towards the river, but otherwise it seemed deserted.</p></div> </div>
