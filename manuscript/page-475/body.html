<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Wondering still more at all that I had seen, I pushed on towards Primrose Hill. Far away, through a gap in the trees, I saw a second Martian, as motionless as the first, standing in the park towards the Zoological Gardens, and silent. A little beyond the ruins about the smashed handling-machine I came upon the red weed again, and found the Regent&rsquo;s Canal, a spongy mass of dark-red vegetation.</p><p>As I crossed the bridge, the sound of &ldquo;Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,&rdquo; ceased. It was, as it were, cut off. The silence came like a thunderclap.</p><p>The dusky houses about me stood faint and tall and dim; the trees towards the park were growing black. All about me the red weed clambered among the ruins, writhing to get above me in the dimness. Night, the mother of fear and mystery, was coming upon me.</p></div> </div>
