The majority of people in London do not read Sunday papers.</p><p>The habit of personal security, moreover, is so deeply fixed in the Londoner&rsquo;s mind, and startling intelligence so much a matter of course in the papers, that they could read without any personal tremors: &ldquo;About seven o&rsquo;clock last night the Martians came out of the cylinder, and, moving about under an armour of metallic shields, have completely wrecked Woking station with the adjacent houses, and massacred an entire battalion of the Cardigan Regiment.
