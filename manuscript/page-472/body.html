<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I was weary after eating, and went into the parlour behind the bar, and slept on a black horsehair sofa I found there.</p><p>I awoke to find that dismal howling still in my ears, &ldquo;Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla.&rdquo; It was now dusk, and after I had routed out some biscuits and a cheese in the bar&mdash;there was a meat safe, but it contained nothing but maggots&mdash;I wandered on through the silent residential squares to Baker Street&mdash;Portman Square is the only one I can name&mdash;and so came out at last upon Regent&rsquo;s Park. And as I emerged from the top of Baker Street, I saw far away over the trees in the clearness of the sunset the hood of the Martian giant from which this howling proceeded. I was not terrified. I came upon him as if it were a matter of course. I watched him for some time, but he did not move. He appeared to be standing and yelling, for no reason that I could discover.</p></div> </div>
