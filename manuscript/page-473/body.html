<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I tried to formulate a plan of action. That perpetual sound of &ldquo;Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,&rdquo; confused my mind. Perhaps I was too tired to be very fearful. Certainly I was more curious to know the reason of this monotonous crying than afraid. I turned back away from the park and struck into Park Road, intending to skirt the park, went along under the shelter of the terraces, and got a view of this stationary, howling Martian from the direction of St. John&rsquo;s Wood. A couple of hundred yards out of Baker Street I heard a yelping chorus, and saw, first a dog with a piece of putrescent red meat in his jaws coming headlong towards me, and then a pack of starving mongrels in pursuit of him. He made a wide curve to avoid me, as though he feared I might prove a fresh competitor. As the yelping died away down the silent road, the wailing sound of &ldquo;Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,&rdquo; reasserted itself.</p></div> </div>
