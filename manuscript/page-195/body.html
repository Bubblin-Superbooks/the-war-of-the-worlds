And through the charred and desolated area&mdash;perhaps twenty square miles altogether&mdash;that encircled the Martian encampment on Horsell Common, through charred and ruined villages among the green trees, through the blackened and smoking arcades that had been but a day ago pine spinneys, crawled the devoted scouts with the heliographs that were presently to warn the gunners of the Martian approach. But the Martians now understood our command of artillery and the danger of human proximity, and not a man ventured within a mile of either cylinder, save at the price of his life.</p><p>It would seem that these giants spent the earlier part of the afternoon in going to and fro, transferring everything from the second and third cylinders&mdash;the second in Addlestone Golf Links and the third at Pyrford&mdash;to their original pit on Horsell Common.</p></div> </div>
