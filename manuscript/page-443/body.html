<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> They haven&rsquo;t any spirit in them&mdash;no proud dreams and no proud lusts; and a man who hasn&rsquo;t one or the other&mdash;Lord! What is he but funk and precautions? They just used to skedaddle off to work&mdash;I&rsquo;ve seen hundreds of &rsquo;em, bit of breakfast in hand, running wild and shining to catch their little season-ticket train, for fear they&rsquo;d get dismissed if they didn&rsquo;t; working at businesses they were afraid to take the trouble to understand; skedaddling back for fear they wouldn&rsquo;t be in time for dinner; keeping indoors after dinner for fear of the back streets, and sleeping with the wives they married, not because they wanted them, but because they had a bit of money that would make for safety in their one little miserable skedaddle through the world. Lives insured and a bit invested for fear of accidents. And on Sundays&mdash;fear of the hereafter.</p></div> </div>
