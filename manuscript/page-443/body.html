<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> As if hell was built for rabbits! Well, the Martians will just be a godsend to these. Nice roomy cages, fattening food, careful breeding, no worry. After a week or so chasing about the fields and lands on empty stomachs, they&rsquo;ll come and be caught cheerful. They&rsquo;ll be quite glad after a bit. They&rsquo;ll wonder what people did before there were Martians to take care of them. And the bar loafers, and mashers, and singers&mdash;I can imagine them. I can imagine them,&rdquo; he said, with a sort of sombre gratification. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be any amount of sentiment and religion loose among them. There&rsquo;s hundreds of things I saw with my eyes that I&rsquo;ve only begun to see clearly these last few days. There&rsquo;s lots will take things as they are&mdash;fat and stupid; and lots will be worried by a sort of feeling that it&rsquo;s all wrong, and that they ought to be doing something.</p></div> </div>
