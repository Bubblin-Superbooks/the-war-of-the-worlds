<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> At the top, near the park gate, I came upon a strange sight&mdash;a bus overturned, and the skeleton of a horse picked clean. I puzzled over this for a time, and then went on to the bridge over the Serpentine. The voice grew stronger and stronger, though I could see nothing above the housetops on the north side of the park, save a haze of smoke to the northwest.</p><p>&ldquo;Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,&rdquo; cried the voice, coming, as it seemed to me, from the district about Regent&rsquo;s Park. The desolating cry worked upon my mind. The mood that had sustained me passed. The wailing took possession of me. I found I was intensely weary, footsore, and now again hungry and thirsty.</p></div> </div>
