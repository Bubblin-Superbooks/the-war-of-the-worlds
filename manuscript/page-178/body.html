The inn was closed, as it was now within prohibited hours.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried a boatman, and &ldquo;Shut up, you fool!&rdquo; said a man near me to a yelping dog. Then the sound came again, this time from the direction of Chertsey, a muffled thud&mdash;the sound of a gun.</p><p>The fighting was beginning. Almost immediately unseen batteries across the river to our right, unseen because of the trees, took up the chorus, firing heavily one after the other. A woman screamed. Everyone stood arrested by the sudden stir of battle, near us and yet invisible to us. Nothing was to be seen save flat meadows, cows feeding unconcernedly for the most part, and silvery pollard willows motionless in the warm sunlight.</p></div> </div>
