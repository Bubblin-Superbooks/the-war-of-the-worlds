<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Most of the spectators had gathered in one or two groups&mdash;one a little crowd towards Woking, the other a knot of people in the direction of Chobham. Evidently they shared my mental conflict. There were few near me. One man I approached&mdash;he was, I perceived, a neighbour of mine, though I did not know his name&mdash;and accosted. But it was scarcely a time for articulate conversation.</p><p>&ldquo;What ugly brutes!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Good God! What ugly brutes!&rdquo; He repeated this over and over again.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you see a man in the pit?&rdquo; I said; but he made no answer to that. We became silent, and stood watching for a time side by side, deriving, I fancy, a certain comfort in one another&rsquo;s company.</p></div> </div>
