<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It&rsquo;s a sort of disloyalty, after all, to live and taint the race. And they can&rsquo;t be happy. Moreover, dying&rsquo;s none so dreadful; it&rsquo;s the funking makes it bad. And in all those places we shall gather. Our district will be London. And we may even be able to keep a watch, and run about in the open when the Martians keep away. Play cricket, perhaps. That&rsquo;s how we shall save the race. Eh? It&rsquo;s a possible thing? But saving the race is nothing in itself. As I say, that&rsquo;s only being rats. It&rsquo;s saving our knowledge and adding to it is the thing. There men like you come in. There&rsquo;s books, there&rsquo;s models. We must make great safe places down deep, and get all the books we can; not novels and poetry swipes, but ideas, science books. That&rsquo;s where men like you come in. We must go to the British Museum and pick all those books through.</p></div> </div>
