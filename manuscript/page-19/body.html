<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Men like Schiaparelli watched the red planet&mdash;it is odd, by-the-bye, that for countless centuries Mars has been the star of war&mdash;but failed to interpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings they mapped so well. All that time the Martians must have been getting ready.</p><p>During the opposition of 1894 a great light was seen on the illuminated part of the disk, first at the Lick Observatory, then by Perrotin of Nice, and then by other observers. English readers heard of it first in the issue of Nature dated August 2. I am inclined to think that this blaze may have been the casting of the huge gun, in the vast pit sunk into their planet, from which their shots were fired at us. Peculiar markings, as yet unexplained, were seen near the site of that outbreak during the next two oppositions.</p></div> </div>
