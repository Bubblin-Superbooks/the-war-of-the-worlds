After Weybridge I went south&mdash;thinking. I saw what was up. Most of the people were hard at it squealing and exciting themselves. But I&rsquo;m not so fond of squealing. I&rsquo;ve been in sight of death once or twice; I&rsquo;m not an ornamental soldier, and at the best and worst, death&mdash;it&rsquo;s just death. And it&rsquo;s the man that keeps on thinking comes through. I saw everyone tracking away south. Says I, &lsquo;Food won&rsquo;t last this way,&rsquo; and I turned right back. I went for the Martians like a sparrow goes for man.</p></div> </div>
