He made up his mind to run down that night to me, in order, as he says, to see the Things before they were killed. He dispatched a telegram, which never reached me, about four o&rsquo;clock, and spent the evening at a music hall.</p><p>In London, also, on Saturday night there was a thunderstorm, and my brother reached Waterloo in a cab.
