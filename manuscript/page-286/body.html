<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Out of the way, there!&rdquo; bawled a coachman, towering high; and my brother saw a closed carriage turning into the lane.</p><p>The people crushed back on one another to avoid the horse. My brother pushed the pony and chaise back into the hedge, and the man drove by and stopped at the turn of the way. It was a carriage, with a pole for a pair of horses, but only one was in the traces. My brother saw dimly through the dust that two men lifted out something on a white stretcher and put it gently on the grass beneath the privet hedge.</p><p>One of the men came running to my brother.</p></div> </div>
