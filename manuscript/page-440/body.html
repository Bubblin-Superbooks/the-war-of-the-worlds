<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I mean that men like me are going on living&mdash;for the sake of the breed. I tell you, I&rsquo;m grim set on living. And if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, you&rsquo;ll show what insides you&rsquo;ve got, too, before long. We aren&rsquo;t going to be exterminated. And I don&rsquo;t mean to be caught either, and tamed and fattened and bred like a thundering ox. Ugh! Fancy those brown creepers!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do. I&rsquo;m going on, under their feet. I&rsquo;ve got it planned; I&rsquo;ve thought it out. We men are beat. We don&rsquo;t know enough. We&rsquo;ve got to learn before we&rsquo;ve got a chance. And we&rsquo;ve got to live and keep independent while we learn. See! That&rsquo;s what has to be done.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
