It seemed to me, too, that the house was inconveniently chosen, and required a needless length of tunnel. And just as I was beginning to face these things, the artilleryman stopped digging, and looked at me.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re working well,&rdquo; he said. He put down his spade. &ldquo;Let us knock off a bit&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s time we reconnoitred from the roof of the house.&rdquo;</p><p>I was for going on, and after a little hesitation he resumed his spade; and then suddenly I was struck by a thought. I stopped, and so did he at once.</p></div> </div>
