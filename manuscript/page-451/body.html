<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Not a Martian in &rsquo;em, but men&mdash;men who have learned the way how. It may be in my time, even&mdash;those men. Fancy having one of them lovely things, with its Heat-Ray wide and free! Fancy having it in control! What would it matter if you smashed to smithereens at the end of the run, after a bust like that? I reckon the Martians&rsquo;ll open their beautiful eyes! Can&rsquo;t you see them, man? Can&rsquo;t you see them hurrying, hurrying&mdash;puffing and blowing and hooting to their other mechanical affairs? Something out of gear in every case. And swish, bang, rattle, swish! Just as they are fumbling over it, swish comes the Heat-Ray, and, behold! man has come back to his own.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
