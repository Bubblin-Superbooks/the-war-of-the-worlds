He was going on as I came out of my front door, lugging my treasures, done up in a tablecloth. I shouted after him:</p><p>&ldquo;What news?&rdquo;</p><p>He turned, stared, bawled something about &ldquo;crawling out in a thing like a dish cover,&rdquo; and ran on to the gate of the house at the crest. A sudden whirl of black smoke driving across the road hid him for a moment. I ran to my neighbour&rsquo;s door and rapped to satisfy myself of what I already knew, that his wife had gone to London with him and had locked up their house. I went in again, according to my promise, to get my servant&rsquo;s box, lugged it out, clapped it beside her on the tail of the dog cart, and then caught the reins and jumped up into the driver&rsquo;s seat beside my wife.</p></div> </div>
