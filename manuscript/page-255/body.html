And through this two Martians slowly waded, and turned their hissing steam jets this way and that.</p><p>They were sparing of the Heat-Ray that night, either because they had but a limited supply of material for its production or because they did not wish to destroy the country but only to crush and overawe the opposition they had aroused. In the latter aim they certainly succeeded. Sunday night was the end of the organised opposition to their movements.</p></div> </div>
