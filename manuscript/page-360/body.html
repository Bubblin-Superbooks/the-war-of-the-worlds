<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Only one other part of the body had a strong case for survival, and that was the hand, &ldquo;teacher and agent of the brain.&rdquo; While the rest of the body dwindled, the hands would grow larger.</p><p>There is many a true word written in jest, and here in the Martians we have beyond dispute the actual accomplishment of such a suppression of the animal side of the organism by the intelligence. To me it is quite credible that the Martians may be descended from beings not unlike ourselves, by a gradual development of brain and hands (the latter giving rise to the two bunches of delicate tentacles at last) at the expense of the rest of the body. Without the body the brain would, of course, become a mere selfish intelligence, without any of the emotional substratum of the human being.</p></div> </div>
