Slowly a humped shape rose out of the pit, and the ghost of a beam of light seemed to flicker out from it.</p><p>Forthwith flashes of actual flame, a bright glare leaping from one to another, sprang from the scattered group of men. It was as if some invisible jet impinged upon them and flashed into white flame. It was as if each man were suddenly and momentarily turned to fire.</p></div> </div>
