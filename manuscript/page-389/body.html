We have sinned, we have fallen short. There was poverty, sorrow; the poor were trodden in the dust, and I held my peace. I preached acceptable folly&mdash;my God, what folly!&mdash;when I should have stood up, though I died for it, and called upon them to repent&mdash;repent! . . .

The wine press of God!&rdquo;</p><p>Then he would suddenly revert to the matter of the food I withheld from him, praying, begging, weeping, at last threatening. He began to raise his voice&mdash;I prayed him not to. He perceived a hold on me&mdash;he threatened he would shout and bring the Martians upon us. For a time that scared me; but any concession would have shortened our chance of escape beyond estimating.</p></div> </div>
