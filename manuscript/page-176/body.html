Patrols of soldiers&mdash;here no longer hussars, but grenadiers in white&mdash;were warning people to move now or to take refuge in their cellars as soon as the firing began. We saw as we crossed the railway bridge that a growing crowd of people had assembled in and about the railway station, and the swarming platform was piled with boxes and packages.
