It picked its road as it went striding along, and the brazen hood that surmounted it moved to and fro with the inevitable suggestion of a head looking about. Behind the main body was a huge mass of white metal like a gigantic fisherman&rsquo;s basket, and puffs of green smoke squirted out from the joints of the limbs as the monster swept by me. And in an instant it was gone.</p><p>So much I saw then, all vaguely for the flickering of the lightning, in blinding highlights and dense black shadows.</p></div> </div>
