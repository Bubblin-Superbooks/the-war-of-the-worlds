But I set it down, and the reader must form his judgment as he will.</p><p>And when, by an effort, I had set aside that picture of a prostrate body, I faced the problem of the Martians and the fate of my wife.

I found myself sitting up in bed, staring at the dark. I found myself praying that the Heat-Ray might have suddenly and painlessly struck her out of being. Since the night of my return from Leatherhead I had not prayed. I had uttered prayers, fetish prayers, had prayed as heathens mutter charms when I was in extremity; but now I prayed indeed, pleading steadfastly and sanely, face to face with the darkness of God.</p></div> </div>
