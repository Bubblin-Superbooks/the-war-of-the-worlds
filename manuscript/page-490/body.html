<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I found myself in a house of kindly people, who had found me on the third day wandering, weeping, and raving through the streets of St. John&rsquo;s Wood. They have told me since that I was singing some insane doggerel about &ldquo;The Last Man Left Alive! Hurrah! The Last Man Left Alive!&rdquo; Troubled as they were with their own affairs, these people, whose name, much as I would like to express my gratitude to them, I may not even give here, nevertheless cumbered themselves with me, sheltered me, and protected me from myself. Apparently they had learned something of my story from me during the days of my lapse.</p><p>Very gently, when my mind was assured again, did they break to me what they had learned of the fate of Leatherhead. Two days after I was imprisoned it had been destroyed, with every soul in it, by a Martian.</p></div> </div>
