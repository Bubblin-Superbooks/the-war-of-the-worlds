<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In the back of this head or body&mdash;I scarcely know how to speak of it&mdash;was the single tight tympanic surface, since known to be anatomically an ear, though it must have been almost useless in our dense air. In a group round the mouth were sixteen slender, almost whiplike tentacles, arranged in two bunches of eight each. These bunches have since been named rather aptly, by that distinguished anatomist, Professor Howes, the hands. Even as I saw these Martians for the first time they seemed to be endeavouring to raise themselves on these hands, but of course, with the increased weight of terrestrial conditions, this was impossible. There is reason to suppose that on Mars they may have progressed upon them with some facility.</p><p>The internal anatomy, I may remark here, as dissection has since shown, was almost equally simple.</p></div> </div>
