<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was nearly eleven when I started to return. The night was unexpectedly dark; to me, walking out of the lighted passage of my cousins&rsquo; house, it seemed indeed black, and it was as hot and close as the day. Overhead the clouds were driving fast, albeit not a breath stirred the shrubs about us. My cousins&rsquo; man lit both lamps. Happily, I knew the road intimately. My wife stood in the light of the doorway, and watched me until I jumped up into the dog cart. Then abruptly she turned and went in, leaving my cousins side by side wishing me good hap.</p><p>I was a little depressed at first with the contagion of my wife&rsquo;s fears, but very soon my thoughts reverted to the Martians. At that time I was absolutely in the dark as to the course of the evening&rsquo;s fighting.</p></div> </div>
